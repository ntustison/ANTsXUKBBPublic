# Conclusion

The UK Biobank is an invaluable resource for large-scale epidemiological
research which includes a thorough neuroimaging battery for a significant subset
of the study volunteers.  For quantitative exploration and inference of
population trends from leveraging imaging data, well-vetted measurement tools
are essential.  The primary contribution that we have described is the
generation and public availability of the set of UK Biobank neuroimaging
structural IDPs generated using the ANTsX ecosystem.  These ANTsX IDPs, which
includes DeepFLASH for hippocampal and extra-hippocampal parcellation,
complement the existing sets of FSL and FreeSurfer IDPs.  A predictive modeling
strategy using a variety of sociodemographic target variables was used to
explore IDP viability, importance, and utility via linear modeling.
